# README

Description:
A ruby app to help others find resources to ease the pain of learning something new.  


# How this site is built:
The site is broken down into a set of units.  Each unit has 3 primary categories that the user can drill down by to find what they are looking for.  
Unit Sections:
I. Learning Stage
  1. Wtf 
  During this stage, everything is hard.  You go to the official documentation and feel like you are understanding only a tiny fraction of what is being discussed. WTF! or WTF? are not foreign to your mind in this stage.  

  2. Squares are rectangles?
  You have figured out the very basics, but are struggling to take what you have learned beyond the precise use-cases that you have previously seen.  What you desire most is a resource that provides plenty of support one up from ground level.  

  3. Not drowning, Not Swimming
  Congrats, you figured out that a square is a type of rectangle and are able to make minor adjustments to get your code to run.  At this point it's time to improve on your code.  Tone down the excitement when the code runs without breaking and look for some best-practice solutions to the problems you are trying to solve. 

II.  All Around Helpers and Practice
-Resources within this section help the reader work through a unit from the bottom up with a ton of coding exercises or code-alongs.  Generally, these resources require several hours to work through, however, yield a significant ROI. 

III.  Lessons learned through pain:
-Advice passed along from another flatiron student on how to save a few hours of bashing your head against a wall.

Tags: tags are the names of lessons that a resource contributor can choose to include to more specifically highlight how they were helped.
